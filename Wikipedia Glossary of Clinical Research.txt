<ul><li><b>Subject Identification Code</b></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>A unique identifier assigned by the investigator to each trial subject to protect the subject's identity and used in lieu of the subject's name when the investigator reports adverse events and/or other trial-related data. (ICH E6)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Subject/Trial Subject</b></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>An individual who participates in a clinical trial, either as a recipient of the investigational product(s) or as a control. (ICH E6)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<ul><li><b>Treatment effect</b></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>An effect attributed to a treatment in a clinical trial. In most clinical trials the treatment effect of interest is a comparison (or contrast) of two or more treatments. (ICH E9)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<ul><li><b><a href=""/wiki/Treatment_IND"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Treatment IND"">Treatment IND</a></b></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>IND stands for Investigational New Drug application, which is part of the process to get approval from the FDA for marketing a new prescription drug in the U.S. It makes promising new drugs available to desperately ill participants as early in the drug development process as possible. Treatment INDs are made available to participants before general marketing begins, typically during Phase III studies. To be considered for a treatment IND a participant cannot be eligible to be in the definitive clinical trial. (NLM)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>A statistical test that is used to find out if there is a real difference between the means (averages) of two different groups. It is sometimes used to see if there is a significant difference in response to treatment between groups in a clinical trial. (NCI)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Uncontrolled study</b></li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction</b></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). (ICH E6)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Vulnerable Subjects</b></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical trial may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. Examples are members of a group with a hierarchical structure, such as medical, pharmacy, dental, and nursing students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the pharmaceutical industry, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention.
